ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.rst
* build.sh
* build.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => app/src/main/jni/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)


Building this App from Source manually
Instructions here are for development on Linux.

Requirements
In order to build this application, you need the following:

Flite 2.0.0 or later. A version can be downloaded from http://www.festvox.org/flite/packed/flite-2.0/flite-2.0.0-release.tar.bz2
Android NDK Release 15c
Android SDK Release 26.0.2
Application Build Steps
Export necessary environment variables

#export FLITEDIR=/path/to/flite-2.0.0
export FLITEDIR=/home/m1035364/Toyota_project_doc/VikasProjectData/IndianLanguage/voiceV2.1/flite-2.1-release
#export FLITE_APP_DIR=/path/to/this/application
export FLITE_APP_DIR=/home/m1035364/Toyota_project_doc/VikasProjectData/IndianLanguage/FliteTTSEngine/app/src/main/jni
#export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android/ndk
export ANDROID_NDK=/home/m1035364/Android/Sdk/android-ndk-r15c
#export ANDROID_SDK=/path/to/android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK=/home/m1035364/Android/Sdk
Build Flite Engine for multiple architectures

cd $FLITEDIR
./configure --with-langvox=android --target=armeabi-android
make
./configure --with-langvox=android --target=armeabiv7a-android
make
./configure --with-langvox=android --target=x86-android
make

#ndk-build -C ./app/src/main/jni/
#ndk-build clean -C ../../FliteTTSEngine/app/src/main/jni/
done the needfull changes in the module level gradle like
in defaultConfig
ndk {
            moduleName "ttsflite"
            abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a','x86'
     }
below buildtype
externalNativeBuild {
        ndkBuild {
            path './src/main/jni/Android.mk'
        }
    }

./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
output done
implement the storage permission or give manual permission to app
